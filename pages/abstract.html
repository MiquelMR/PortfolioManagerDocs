                Abstract
                The economic situation and its impact on people's lives have shown their less favorable side in recent
                years: unemployment, economic crises, uncertainty, and, more recently, inflation. This presents
                individuals
                with the need to make financial decisions that allow them to avoid or at least mitigate the most
                impoverishing effects of economic reality. In some cases, these decisions may lead them to prosper
                through
                work and savings. However, it is precisely the complexity of the economic world that makes it difficult
                or
                even impossible to reach valid conclusions about which financial decisions should be made. Although the
                solution is also complex, technology can assist in this endeavor.
                Portfolio Manager emerges as a practical and accessible solution designed to help users manage their
                investments by providing information on financial assets, analysis of their behavior in different
                economic
                environments, and investment strategies, while also fostering knowledge sharing within a community.
                Thanks to its architecture based on WebAssembly and a cloud-hosted API, Portfolio Manager enables users
                to
                access financial information in real time from any browser without requiring additional software
                installation. Furthermore, its scalable design ensures that the platform can evolve and improve
                continuously
                after its launch.
                Ultimately, Portfolio Manager is a tool for organizing personal investments that delivers its services
                through the cloud. It includes a space for sharing investment ideas and is designed to be scalable.
