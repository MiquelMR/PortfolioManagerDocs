He felt you wanted a portfolio that would do well in prosperity (stocks), deflation (long Treasuries), inflation (gold), and “tight money or recession” (cash). There are lots of variations. There is even a one-stop shop mutual fund for 82 basis points that's been around since 1982 with 15-year average returns of a little over 7%. Not only did it lose money in 2008, it managed to do so in 2013, 2015, and 2022 as well. From 2010-2020, it did rather poorly when compared to the roaring stock market, demonstrating its severe tracking error, but in five of the past six years, it's gained over 10% per year.",
